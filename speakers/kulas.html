      Mike Kulas has been working in the game industry since 1981. Throughout the 80's he worked for Sublogic and BAO on numerous versions of Flight Simulator and related products. He worked briefly for LookingGlass Technologies before cofounding Parallax Software with Matt Toschlog in 1993. In 1996 Mike founded Volition as a spinoff of Parallax Software. He is married with three children. About a year ago he awoke to the realization he was no longer a programmer. He hopes to pick up programming after his retirement in about thirty years.</p>
