Kyoung Shin Park is a doctoral candidate in computer science at
University of Illinois at Chicago's Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). Her dissertation research is focused on developing techniques and designs for
supporting long-term collaborative work in Amplified Collaboration
Environments. Amplified Collaboration Environments are display-rich
project rooms that allow distributed scientists and engineers to work together
in intensive collaborative campaigns. Her research interests include
human-computer interaction, collaboration systems, interactive
visualization, high-performance adaptive networking, and multimedia
design.</p>
<p>
Park is a member of EVL's tele-immersion group, which investigates
human-centered technology as applied to distributed scientific
collaboration. Her work at EVL includes developing network performance
monitoring and visualization tools, creating CAVE art applications in
cooperation with EVL artists, and designing/conducting various human
factors studies.
