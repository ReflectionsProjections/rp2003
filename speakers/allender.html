      <p>Mark worked briefly with Mike Kulas at SubLogic in the early 1990's before beginning a 2 year hiatus from the game industry to work for IBM in sunny Tucson. In 1994, a chance meeting on the internet brought Mark back in contact with Mike. Mark has been at Volition ever since, working on various titles including Descent, Descent II, FreeSpace, Summoner, with cameo programming appearances on several other titles. He is currently the Technical Director, which means that he spends far less time programming than ever before. </p>
