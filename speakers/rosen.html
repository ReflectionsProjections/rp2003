Zack would be a Junior in computer science at the University of Illinois
if he did not defer his enrollment to take a job on Howard Dean's
presidential campaign as a web developer.  Early this past summer he
started an open source development project to create web-community
software for Dean's grassroots campaign.  Now in it's third month of
development, DeanSpace is being adopted by campaign communities and
state field offices to create peer-moderated websites that can share
content and users accross a network of other campaign sites.
