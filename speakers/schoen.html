	(EFF) Staff Technologist, helping other technologists understand the
	civil liberties implications of their work, EFF staff better
	understand the underlying technology related to EFF's legal work, and
	the public understand what the technology products they use really do.

	senior consultant. While at Linuxcare, Schoen helped create the
	Linuxcare Bootable Business Card CD-ROM. Prior to Linuxcare, Schoen
	worked at AtreNet, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
