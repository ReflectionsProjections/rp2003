      <p>
The Continuum is an amplified collaboration environment that support
collaborative scientific investigation using advanced computation and
visualization technologies. The goal of this research is to enhance
collaboration among distantly located teams of experts gathered to
intensively solve problems. An exploratory design study was conducted
to evaluate how small groups in distributed Continuum spaces perform a
number of scientific tasks with the variation of technology configurations.
This presentation will provide an overview of the current Continuum
research and the findings of the Continuum design study.
