      <p>
Over the past three years the level of sophistication and frequency of software attacks has increased industry wide. This talk will examine the "attack software technology" used in recent software attacks on the Windows operating system and will discuss the work Microsoft is doing to improve resistance to future attacks. The talk will discuss how advances in tools, engineering practices, and development process all contribute to improving the ability of the “cyber immune system” to fend off viral attacks and make it harder for “epidemics” we have experienced in the past to continue.
