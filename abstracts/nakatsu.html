      <p>
Recently various types of immersive communications/interactions between human and computer as well as between human and human became popular. Interactive multimedia systems and video games are good examples. Immersive interactions are, as far as they are well designed, activate our mind and make us creative. Therefore how AI technologies can be applied to realize immersive interactions is an important research issue. In my talk, I want to propose the concept of Immersive Computing and explain how AI technologies can realize immersive human-computer and human-human interactions.
